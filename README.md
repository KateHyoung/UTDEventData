The UTDEventData R package provides an interface to extract data from the UTD Event Data server. This package is stable and actively maintained/updated. Your comments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.   
If you have any question regarding the package, please contact Marcus Sianan <Marcus.Sianan@UTDallas.edu>, or open an issue (<https://github.com/KateHyoung/UTDEventData/issues>).

Note: Our server now provides the access to *'CLINE_PHOENIX_LNNYT'* data that contains several million events from 17.5 million news stories from New York Times (1945 - 2019) that is provided by Open Event Data Alliance. You can find more information by clicking the link [here](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-0647142). 

This package is part of the "Modernizing Political Event Data for Big Data Social Science Research" project. More information can be found on [the project webpage](https://eventdata.utdallas.edu).

Several functions to preview and download data are listed below. More details of these methods are illustrated in the vignette. 

- citeData( ): for citing the package and data tables in the UTD server for publications
- DataTables( ): for looking up data tables in the UTD server 
- tableVar( ): for looking up the variables of a data table
- previewData( ): for previewing the data structure of a data table
- pullData( ): for downloading data by countries and time periods 
- entireData( ): for downloading an entire data table
- getQuerySize(): for measuring the size of requested data from the UTD server
- sendQuery( ): for requesting built queries from the API server to download data
- Table: a reference class 

****

Leaf Query Block functions:

- returnTimes( ): create a query block by time periods
- returnCountries( ): create a query block by countries
- returnLatLon( ): create a query block by latitude and longitude
- returnDyad( ): create a query block of a dyad for both source and target actors
- returnRegExp( ): create a query block by pattern of attributes in a data table

Branch Query Block functions:

- orList( ): match records that satisfy any of the child query blocks 
- andList( ): match records that satisfy all of the child query blocks 

## Installation

Without the vignette:
```
devtools::install_github("KateHyoung/UTDEventData") 
```

With the vignette:
```
devtools::install_github("KateHyoung/UTDEventData", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

Users with newer versions of R may need to follow this format:
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(remotes)
install_github("KateHyoung/UTDEventData")
library(devtools)
library(UTDEventData)
```

## Retrieve an API key

Access to the UTD data server requires an API key. To obtain an API key, follow the link and fill the form: <https://eventdata.utdallas.edu/signup>. Please check your spam and junk email if you do not receive the API key in your inbox.

## Using the API key
#### Method 1: Pass the key as the first argument
You will need to pass the key on every function call.  
```
k <- '...your API key....'
DataTables(utd_api_key = k)
```

#### Method 2: Store the key in an environment variable 
Set the default API key by setting the environment variable `UTDAPIKEY`.
```
Sys.setenv(UTDAPIKEY = "...your API key...")

DataTables()
tableVar(table = "icews", lword = "target")
```
*Note: Method 2 currently works only with `DataTabes()`, `tableVar()`, and `previewData()`. We plan to expand this method to other functions that require an API key.*

Further examples will assume the api key is set in an environment variable. 

## Data Preview
Retrieve a sample of 100 observations.  
```
dataSample <- previewData(table_name = "PHOENIX_RT")
View(dataSample)
```
## Data Download (quick) 
`pullData()` can be used to retrieve data subsetted by country names and dates. 
```
subset1 <- pullData(table_name = "phoenix_rt", country = list('canada','China'), start = '20171101',  end = '20171102', T)
```

## Data Download (custom)
More complex queries with intersections, unions and multiple sets of constraints may be submitted via the `sendQuery()` function. More details on this method are provided in the vignette.  


## Example Usage
   
```
dt <- pullData('utd_api_key', "Phoenix_rt", list("RUS", "SYR"), start="20180101", end="20180331", citation = F)

## querying the fight event by CAMEO codes

Fgt <- dt[dt$code %in% c("190", "191", "192", "193", "194", "195", "1951", "1952", "196"),]
Fgt <- Fgt[,1:23] ## remove url and oid columns

tb <- table(Fgt$country_code, Fgt$month) # monthly incidents

barplot(tb, main = "Monthly Fight Incidents between RUS and SYR", col=c("darkblue", "red"),
        legend = rownames(tb), beside=TRUE,  xlab="Month in 2018")
```

![](vignettes/figures/fig1.jpg){width=70%}

Military related fights between Russia and Syria from January 2018 to March 2018 are depicted by month. Event types are articulated by [CAMEO codes](http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/cameo.html) in Phoenix real-time data. 

## Vignette
Access the vignette by executing the following R snippet. This requires an initial package installation with `build_vignette=TRUE`.

```
vignette("UTDEventData")
```
